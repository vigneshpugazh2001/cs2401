    This is the record of a person waiting for an appointment for their
    COVID-19 vaccine. It includes the person's name, age and the date
    and time when they called in to get the appointment.
    Overloaded comparison operators compare the time they called in,
    with less than meanng that the left operand has called in earlier
    than the righ operand.
